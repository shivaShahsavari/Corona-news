"Analyzing Dutch News related to Corona"

By the beginnig of Covid-19 infection cases in Netherlands, we came up with the idea of Analyzing Dutch News in this regard.
To do so, we had four different approaches:

1- Polarity identification : to determine the news are Negative or Positive (a kind of sentiment analysis)
2- Topic Classification : to classify utch news in four categories of Healthcare, Economic, Travel and Science
3- Emotion Recognition : to extracting which emotions can be recognized from the news
4- Fact checking : to recognize whether the news are reliable or not


Notes: Codes of each approach and the results are in related folders

To accomplish all of mentioned approaches, we scraped news from different sources such as google news of USA and Netherlands, 
RIVM, WHO, Dutch government and Poynter (an international platform including collection of False and misleading news).
Our collected data are also inserted in corresponding folders.
